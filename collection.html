            On this non-limited watch, fiery red tones contrast with the bright white dial and VELCRO® strap. The chronograph seconds hand is red, while the subdials hands at 10 and 2 o'clock sport unique red hands in a playful spacecraft shape, a special nod to the OMEGA Speedmaster Alaska II. The subdial hand at 6 o'clock is in black while the hour and minute hand are two-toned in white and black. The bezel is white and sports a black tachymeter scale. All dials in the collection carry the OMEGA X Swatch branding, the iconic Speedmaster logo and the MoonSwatch logo. The biosourced glass construction, the etched 'S' integrated in the center of the glass, the fine and sophisticated circular pattern on the dial outer ring and the recessed subdials, the angular and smooth lugs construction, the iconic “dot over 90” detail on the tachymeter scale, and of course the unique Bioceramic feel are common to all models. The hour, minute and chronograph seconds hands, as well the subdials hands at 10 and 2 o'clock and hour markers sport Super-LumiNova® for a perfect glow in the dark.<br><br>

            This steel gray non-limited watch is complete with a black VELCRO® strap. All the hands and tachymeter scale are in white, just like in the original Moonwatch. The bezel is in black. All dials in the collection carry the OMEGA X Swatch branding, the iconic Speedmaster logo and the MoonSwatch logo. The biosourced glass construction, the etched 'S' integrated in the center of the glass, the fine and sophisticated circular pattern on the dial outer ring and the recessed subdials, the angular and smooth lugs construction, the iconic “dot over 90” detail on the tachymeter scale, and of course the unique Bioceramic feel are common to all models. The hour, minute, and chronograph seconds hands as well as the hour markers sport Super-LumiNova® for a perfect glow in the dark.<br><br>

            data-description="<br>
            Aptly named “NEW MOON”, this non-limited model boasts an elegant all-black color scheme. It features a Bioceramic case, crown and pushers as well as a VELCRO® strap. The chronograph seconds hand, subdial hands, and tachymeter scale are in white. The subdials and bezel are in black. This model stands out with its black moon phase function, arguably the most poetic of all watch complications. Snoopy who has been associated with human space missions since the 1960s, is featured lying on the moon on the moon phase disc, which rotates in the subdial set at 2 o’clock. Under UV light, a hidden quote from a Snoopy comic strip nestled amidst crescent moons and stars, is revealed on the unique subdial. All dials in the collection carry the OMEGA X Swatch branding, the iconic Speedmaster logo and the MoonSwatch logo. The box-shaped biosourced glass construction, the etched 'S' in the center of the glass referencing the Swatch logo, the fine and sophisticated circular pattern on the dial outer ring and the recessed subdials, the sharp and smooth lugs construction, the iconic “dot over 90” detail on the tachymeter scale and of course the unique Bioceramic feel are common to all models. The indexes, hour and minute hands and chronograph seconds hand sport Grade A Super-LumiNova® for a perfect glow in the dark. <br><br>

In 2020, the watch #OPENSUMMER (SUOK148) ticks the open conversation about diversity, inclusiveness, openness and love.Red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, blue for serenity, and purple for spirit. The creator of the iconic LGBTQ Pride flag, Gilbert Baker, surely knew this recipe by heart. The 1978 ballroom scenario of color, light, movement and pure magic was the trigger and the inspiration – like a rainbow, the ancient symbol of hope. Today, it’s a sign of love and diversity that inspires and moves millions of people around the world.<br><br>

As a teenager, he scribbled his first day on a skateboard ramp before immortalizing himself on trains and in the streets of Toulouse, inspired by his numerous travels. A distinctive feature of his works is the highly effective, voluptuous, round, and colorful shapes that symbolize his love for women. For his design of the Swatch Gent, he used the lyrics of a famous French rock band from the 1980s, 'Téléphone.' These lyrics are printed across the entire watch in bright, colorful, round letters. The water-resistant watch features a precise, battery-powered quartz movement.<br><br>

            The rare Swatch RED REBEL is part of the New Gent product line. These watches are significantly larger than the classic Swatch Gent. Its striking red color, excellent legibility, and large date display are striking. The watch has a matching silicone strap, is water-resistant, and has a precise battery-powered quartz movement. This model is now very rare and sought after, as it is rarely offered for sale. This rare classic dates back to 2010.<br><br>

            data-description="<br>
            CUCKOOLUS is an exceptional Swatch New Gent Special designed by the German artist Tobias Rehberger. From the 12th June 2016, art is on a new pedestrian path between Fondation Beyeler in Riehen near Basel and the Vitra Campus in the German Weil am Rhein, which is presented by Swatch. There are 24 objects by the artist on the cross-border, 5-kilometer route, each of the colorful signposts invites you to linger and think. People should take the time to enjoy a unique living collage of sculptures, colors and landscapes. The watch itself is completely created in black, with orange accents. Unfortunately, there is no more cuckoo sound when the packaging is opened, since the battery responsible for it is now empty.There are two equal hands on the dial, so the wearer always has to think about which of the two possible times of the day it is. The Swatch Art Special is available in a limited edition of 4962 pieces, one for every meter of the route. The cuckoo clock look is underlined by the tree trunk shape of the special packaging.<br><br>
